## Program Overview

Quiz Pop is a three-part pop quiz program. The main page allows you to choose one of the three categories: music, modern art, or coding. Each category consists of 10 questions, with each question having four options to choose from. You can only select one answer for each question.

After selecting an answer, click the "Check" button to validate your answer. The screen will update to show if you got the answer right or wrong. The "Check" button will then disappear and be replaced by the "Next" button. Clicking the "Next" button will take you to the next question.

Once a question is completed, you cannot go back to it. If you need to exit the quiz, you can click the "Close" button at the top. If you refresh the page and resume the quiz, it will start at the question after the last question you answered. For example, if you exited after question 4 of the music category, it will start at question 5 of the music category.

After completing all the questions in a category, a "Submit" button will appear. Clicking the "Submit" button will return you to the main category page. The completed category will be grayed out and cannot be entered again. On the main category page, there is a "Score" button after each category. Clicking the "Score" button will display your score for that category.

Continue to the next category until you have completed the entire quiz and all three categories are grayed out. Click the "Score" button on the main category page to view your final score.

Study hard, good luck, and have fun!
